README_waterbalance_monthly

These ****_waterbalance_monthly files contain monthly, watershed-averaged input (meteorlogical) and output (water balance) variables.

The naming convention is LLCC_waterbalance_monthly, where the LL refers to the land use dataset used and CC refers to the climate dataset used.

These are all made using the script Scenarios_SummarizeMonthlyWaterBalance.R

They are from results of these simulations:
"AI08", "ARAI04", "NWAI04", "CCAI04"
"AR07", "AIAR04", "NWAR04", "CCAR04"
"CC07", "AICC04", "NWCC04", "ARCC04"
"NW05", "AINW04", "ARNW04", "CCNW04"

"HistLULC_XXclim" is a special case in which the XX climate (AI, AR, CC, NW) is used for the entire 1986-2070 period, but beginning in 2014 historical land use (2006-2013) is repeated over and over again.
It is intended to capture the impacts of the most extreme future climate given present LULC.
